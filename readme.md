## Description
Retro Board is an app for creating virtual white boards for [agile retrospectives](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Agile-retrospective).
Registered and logged in users are able to create boards with up to 4 named sections. 
The boards can be edited and viewed publicly by anyone. A guest or user editing the board can add or delete notes to
any section of the board as well as up-vote notes that they deem important. 
All updates and changes to the board are synchronized between users seamlessly so multiple people can collaborate on a single board simultaneously.

Other basic features implemented include:
* Automatic reloading front-end
* Authentication required for creation/deletion of boards
* Email confirmation to activate account after registration
* Forgot password functionality
* Customized error pages
* Responsive design
